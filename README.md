## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Float layout
- Sass/SCSS
- Desktop-first workflow
- BEM Methodology for class naming


### What I learned

I learnt a lot by building this project,to mention but few:
- Float layouts
- Grid
- CSS Animations
- CSS Hacks
- Semantic HTML
- Sass
- Responsive design
- Project Organization
and many more................




```js
const HadFun = () => {
  console.log('Yay!ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

Future version will have more functionality added to it, make the website a fullstack project, probably will rebuild it using **ReactJs** Since this is built with purely **HTML/CSS/Sass** no javascript. Watch out for this repo in the futureðŸ™‚
