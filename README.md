## Acknowledgments

I will like to acknowledge [Jonas Schemdtman](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) once more, whose course helped me to understand Flexbox deeply by bulding this project and also i'll like to give credit to [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) website as well, i used it as an introductory resource in learning flexbox, the 'Guide to Flexbox' post by [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) was clear and concise,it helped me. After building this project, i am pretty much confident in using flexbox in my next projects😉.
